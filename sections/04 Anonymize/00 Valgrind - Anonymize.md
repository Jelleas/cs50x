# Section 4: Valgrind and anonymize

For this section you (and two others) will complete up to two exercises (if it fits within the timeframe). You will first tackle an exercise about Valgrind, after which (if there is still time) your group will attempt to anonymize a picture.

## What to do?
1. Debug using [Valgrind](#valgrind)
2. Implement [Anonymize](#anonymize)

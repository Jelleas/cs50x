# Skip

## Goal

Write a program that takes a string from the user and prints each even character of the string. As per the output below (where the underlined text is the user input):


    $ ./skip
    Type something: Great, gifts!
    Get it!


## Specification
- Write, in a file called `skip.c` in your `~/workspace/section2/` directory.
- Ask the user for a text input.
- Then, print (with the help of `printf` and a loop) only the even characters of this string.
- Compile the file with the command `make skip`.
## Tips
1. How do you check if a number is even or odd? Does the `%`-operator help?

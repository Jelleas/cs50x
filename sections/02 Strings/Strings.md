# Strings

# Getting Started

Like last week, we create a new directory for this weeks group assignment. Execute:


    mkdir ~/workspace/section2

Now, step into this directory:


    cd ~/workspace/section2


# What to do?
1. Implement [Vertical](/sections/02%20Strings/Vertical)
2. Implement [Skip](/sections/02%20Strings/Skip)
3. Implement [Eek](/sections/02%20Strings/Eek)

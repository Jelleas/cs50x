# Strings

## Getting Started

Like last week, log into `cs50.io` and execute


    update50

within a terminal window to make sure your workspace is up-to-date. If you somehow closed your terminal window (and can’t find it!), make sure that Console is checked under the View menu, then click the green, circled plus (+) in CS50 IDE’s bottom half, then select New Terminal.

Next, we create a new directory for this weeks group assignment. Execute:


    mkdir ~/workspace/section2

Now, step into this directory:


    cd ~/workspace/section2


## What to do?
1. Implement [Vertical](/sections/02%20Strings/Vertical.md)
2. Implement [Strings](/Strings)
3. Implement [Eek](/Eek)
